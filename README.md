# ActivityStream 🏞

## Welcome to the Fediverse


This is a personal experiment to explore Activity Streams.  This library is BRAND NEW, and is not ready for use **by anyone**, for **any reason**, at **any time**.  Check out https://github.com/go-fed for a library that's ready for prime time.

## Pull Requests Welcome

This library is a work in progress, and will benefit from your experience reports, use cases, and contributions.  If you have an idea for making Rosetta better, send in a pull request.  We're all in this together! 🏞
