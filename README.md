## Welcome to the Fediverse

This is a personal experiment to explore Activity Streams.  This library is BRAND NEW, and is not ready for use **by anyone**, for **any reason**, at **any time**.  Check out [https://github.com/go-fed](https://github.com/go-fed) for a library that's ready for prime time.

## This is an Experiment

ActivityStreams is so hard to work with in a "strongly typed", "idiomatic go" way, because the W3C spec is so loose with types.  So, I'm revisiting this idea of loosely typed data that's encapsulated by strongly typed constructors.  This technique works great with databases like MongoDB, so I'm giving it another go for ActivityStreams.  This (may?) also help with extendability, as new constructors can be defined outside of the primary Activity Vocabulary.

There are separate libraries for Reading and Writing ActivityStreams data.  They will work something like this:

```go

// WRITING ActivityStreams
writer.Announce(
    writer.Actor().Name("John Doe").ID("john@doe.com").URL("john.doe.com"),
    writer.Document().URL("https://me.website.com/document-name"),
    nil
)

// READING ActivityStreams
object, err := New(`{
    "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    "name": "Foo",
    "id": "http://example.org/foo"
    }`)

object.Name() // "foo"
object.ID() // "http://example.org/foo"

```
